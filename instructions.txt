WARNING: PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION
This script modifies critical system files and configurations on Samsung government-issued devices. Improper use may lead to irreversible damage, permanent bricking, or instability of the device. Follow the steps exactly as outlined below:

Save the Script:

Save the provided script with the exact name: Oblivion-X.sh
Ensure the file is stored in the root directory of the device's internal storage (e.g., /storage/emulated/0/).
Grant Execution Permissions:

Using a terminal (or ADB), navigate to the location where the file is saved.
Run the following command to make the script executable:
shell
Copy code
chmod +x /storage/emulated/0/Oblivion-X.sh
Execute the Script:

Connect your device to a computer using ADB or use a compatible terminal app.
Run the script by executing:

Alternatively, if your file manager supports script execution, tap the file to run it.
Observe and Wait:

Do not interrupt the process. The script will reboot the device automatically once completed.
Post-execution, verify that the intended services (e.g., Knox, enrollment) are removed and disabled.
Note: Interrupting or improperly modifying the script during execution may result in boot loops or a bricked device.
